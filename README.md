# code-challenges
My entries to code challenges for leetcode, project euler, and code.golf.

Please do not look at the code if you do not want to spoil the puzzles.

This was built so that I can visually see tests run and fail based on given sets of test cases rather than relying on the console.

This can also easily browse and run old solutions and view links to their respective code problems.
